# Project Motivation 
Machine learning has been a popular topic in recent years and has been widely used in a variety of ways in life. With this work, we will explore an interesting application of the machine learning technique to identify dog breeds. This work is dedicated to a project in the Udacity nanodegree.
# Modeling Methodology
In this project, a machine learning model called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model has been used to classify and recognize the breed of a dog in an image. Transfer learning technique is used to speed up the model with acceptable accuracy.
