# Project Motivation 
Machine learning has been a popular topic in recent years and has been widely used in a variety of ways in life. With this work, we will explore an interesting application of the machine learning technique to identify dog breeds. This work is dedicated to a project in the Udacity nanodegree.

# Modeling Methodology
In this project, a machine learning model called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model has been used to classify and recognize the breed of a dog in an image. Transfer learning technique is used to speed up the model with acceptable accuracy. 

# Modeling Details 
The details of the model can be divided into the following steps: 
Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dogs
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Write an Algorithm
Step 6: Testing the Algorithm
